# Exercise 4 - Rebasing

## :bulb: Goals for Exercise 4

After this exercise, you will be able to:

- Use `git rebase` to merge changes
- Use `git rebase` in interactive mode
- Use `git pull --rebase` to use rebase when pulling down changes

### 4.1 - Git rebase

We will now put ourselves in a situation similar to before, where we need to merge changes. Instead of using `git merge`, we will use `git rebase`.

:pencil2: Checkout the `main` branch. Pull the latest changes from your pull request that was merged into `main` using `git pull`.

:pencil2: Check out a feature branch, `feature-branch-5`, from the `main` branch. Replace the contents of `index.ts` with the contents of `code/4.1-change-1.ts` from this repository. Commit the changes in your branch.

```mermaid
gitGraph
   commit id: "..."
   branch feature-branch-5
   commit id: "Updated index.ts"
```

:pencil2: Check out the `main` branch, and from the `main` branch, create a new branch, `feature-branch-6`. Replace the contents of `code/index.ts` with the contents of `code/4.1-change-2.ts` from this repository.

```mermaid
gitGraph
   commit id: "..."
   branch feature-branch-5
   commit id: "Updated index.ts (change 1)"
   checkout main
   branch feature-branch-6
   commit id: "Updated index.ts (change 2)"
```

:pencil2: Merge `feature-branch-5` into `main`.

```mermaid
gitGraph
   commit id: "..."
   branch feature-branch-5
   commit id: "Updated index.ts (change 1)"
   checkout main
   branch feature-branch-6
   commit id: "Updated index.ts (change 2)"
   checkout main
   merge feature-branch-5
```

:pencil2: Go into `feature-branch-6`. Rebase the changes from `main` into `feature-branch-6`. You can do this with the following command:

```
git rebase main
```

```mermaid
gitGraph
   commit id: "..."
   branch feature-branch-5
   commit id: "Updated index.ts (change 1)"
   checkout main
   merge feature-branch-5
   checkout feature-branch-5
   checkout main
   branch feature-branch-6
   commit id: "Updated index.ts (change 2)"
```

:pencil2: Use the Merge Editor in VS Code, and resolve your conflict, just like you did in the previous exercise with normal merging

:pencil2: After resolving the config, add the file to the staging area using `git add .`

:pencil2: Continue rebasing by using the command `git rebase --continue` in your terminal

:pencil2: After you have finished rebasing `main` into your branch, checkout the `main` branch and merge `feature-branch-6` in. Since we have rebase `main` into our branch, we have rewritten the history in the branch so that it seems our work always was "on top of" the work in main, and we can easily merge our work. 

:bulb: You generally never want to rebase in main. That would rewrite the history in the shared working branch.

### 4.2 - Git rebase interactive
When you're in a feature branch, you might sometimes want to rewrite commits you've checked in, for example by combining commits or changing a commit message. You can do this with `git rebase` in interactive mode.

We'll use interactive rebase to combine commits.

:pencil2: We are going to create some fictive commit messages that we are going to rebase. In this exercise, you choose your own commit messages and content changes. Do the following tasks: 
- Check out a branch from the `main` branch. Choose your own branch name.
- Create a file, or make changes to an existing file.
- Create a commit.
- Repeat the file change and new commit 3 more times, until you have 4 commits in your branch.

:pencil2: Push your branch to the remote repository.

:pencil2: Use `git rebase` in interactive mode to combine commits. Use the following command:

```
git rebase -i main
```

You will now see an editor window with commits that have happened in your branch since you branched out from `main`. In the example below, there are 4 commits in a branch: `commit 1`, `commit 2`, `commit 3`, `commit 4`.

In the last 3 rows, you can replace the value `pick` with either `s` or `squash`. Squash will combine the commit with the commit above it. As in the case below, `commit 4` will be combined with `commit 3`, which combines with `commit 2`, which combines with `commit 1` (we keep `pick` on `commit 1`).

![alt text](image-1.png)

:pencil2: Save and close the file. You will get a new editor window. Here you can write a new commit message for the combined commits. Remove the content in the file and write an appropriate message. Then save and close the file that appeared.

:pencil2: Try to push the change to the remote repository. You will get a message that the change is not accepted. This is because we have rewritten the history.

:pencil2: Push to branch using the command `git push --force-with-lease`.

:bulb: When you have rewritten the history on a branch that is tracked in a remote repository, you must push changes with a force flag for the change to be accepted. It's tempting to use `git push -f` (or `--force`) which forces the change in. This is OK when working alone. When working in a team, you risk overwriting others' work. It's smart to use the command `git push --force-with-lease` instead, as this forces in the change only if no one else has made any changes since you last pulled the branch.

### 4.3 - Git pull --rebase

:bulb: When you run `git pull`, Git performs a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge`. However, you can use `git pull --rebase` to perform a `git fetch` followed by a `git rebase` instead. This can help maintain a cleaner, more linear history by avoiding merge commits.

When using `git pull --rebase`, your local commits are temporarily set aside, the remote changes are pulled down, and then your local commits are replayed on top of the updated branch. This creates a linear history instead of creating a merge commit like a regular `git pull` would do.

:pencil2:  Let's simulate this difference:
1. Create a new branch called `pull-test` from main
2. Make a change and commit it. Push it to github.com, and merge it to `main` using a pull request.
3. Go back to `main` branch and make a different change and commit it straight to the `main` branch.
4. In the main `branch`, use `git pull` to pull changes in `main` - notice the merge commit (unless you got a fast-forward merge). 
5. Reset the branch with `git reset --hard HEAD~1`.
6. Try `git pull --rebase` instead - notice the linear history and that your commit that you added straight to `main` is now placed after your merged PR. 

:bulb: Careful with `--hard` flag in the future. Dont use this uncritically. This is a massive foot-gun

## What you need

* Make sure Git is installed and is available from the command line (`` git --version`` should not produce an error). [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you do not already have it. 

* A good text editor of your choice, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/).

## How to get started

* Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer, it's easier to read it on GitHub with formatting. We therefore recommend you keep a web browser tab open with the exercise tasks.
* Start by opening [exercise 1](./exercises/exercise-1.md/).
* Remember to ask an instructor if you're stuck.

:exclamation: Do not use a GUI client. Use the terminal/CLI only. You should not copy and paste content. Type it out manually. Remember to follow all the steps in the tutorial.
